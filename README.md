# Data Science Notebooks
All IPython notebooks in this repository can also be viewed on [my personal blog](http://hoanvu.github.io). After converting from IPython notebook to markdown format, it does not look very nice on my Jekyll blog, so I will put them here and share them through [http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) so you can see directly in notebook format.
